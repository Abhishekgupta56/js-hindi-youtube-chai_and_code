const name = "abhishek"
const repo = 50
// console.log(name + repo + "value"); ---> dont use this syntax its out dated morden day industry normls has differnet normls

// for writng the strings in morden normls use the BACKTITS----> `  ` --> by making placeholders

console.log(`hello my name is ${name} and my repo count is ${repo}`);

console.log(`hello my name is ${name.toUpperCase} and my repo count is ${repo}`);
// benefit of this ---> use of method becomes easy

// alternative way to declare the string

const gameName = new String('hiteshhc')
